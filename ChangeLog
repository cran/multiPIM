What’s new in version 1.3-1 (built on 2012-12-07)

  *Added data directory with .rda files for wcgs and schisto data
      can be loaded with data(schisto) or data(wcgs)
  *Parallel processing of bootstrap replicates now uses parallel package
    (distributed as part of core R as of R version 2.14.0)
    i.e. packages multicore and rlecuyer are no longer required when
    multiPIMboot is called with multicore = TRUE.
  *argument rlecuyer.seed to multiPIMboot function has been replaced with the
     argument mc.seed, which should be a single integer
  *Added timing information to multiPIM results
  *Added type argument to summary.multiPIM and summaries now by
     default include breakdown of running time by g vs. Q modeling
     and by super learner candidate in addition to the statistical
     summary by exposure-outcome pair
  *Added this ChangeLog file
  *Split up file R/functions.R into three separate files by functionality:
     -multiPIM.R: definitions of the candidate vectors, multiPIM function
     -multiPIMboot.R: multiPIMboot function
     -summary.R: summary.multiPIM and print.summary.multiPIM functions

What’s new in version 1.2-1 (2011-11-02):

  *Minor updates for compatibility with R version 2.14
  *mutliPIMboot no longer allows for automatic detection of
     number of cores to use when multicore = FALSE

What’s new in version 1.1-2 (2011-09-20):

  *Bug fix: there was an error in the formula which calculates
     plug-in standard errors for IPCW and DR-IPCW estimators.
     This has now been fixed.

What’s new in version 1.1-1 (2011-09-14):

  *New estimators: the default estimator is now TMLE.
     Also, a G-COMP estimator is now available, as well as
     the IPCW and DR-IPCW estimators that were available in
     the previous version.
  *Default for g.method has been changed from super learning
     to main terms logistic regression. This will usually work
     better with the new TMLE estimator.
  *Support for factors in W.
  *standardize argument for use with the lars and penalized
     candidates.
